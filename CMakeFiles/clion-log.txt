CMake Warning at cmake/Modules/LibFindMacros.cmake:263 (message):
  WARNING: MISSING PACKAGE

  We only found some files of ARPACK, not all of them.  Perhaps your
  installation is incomplete or maybe we just didn't look in the right place?
  This package is NOT REQUIRED and you may ignore this warning but by doing
  so you may miss some functionality of SpecHap.

  Relevant CMake configuration variables:

    ARPACK_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/arpack
    ARPACK_LIBRARY=<not found>

  You may use CMake GUI, cmake -D or ccmake to modify the values.  Delete
  CMakeCache.txt to discard all values and force full re-detection if
  necessary.

Call Stack (most recent call first):
